# The-Roundtable-App
The App allows a group of people create a session just like a Whatsapp group to enable them share group messages and attachments eg photos! After the session everything gets deleted. Works like an online stand-up meeting!

The manager might not like being being in a group with the employees or vice versa, but with this app, they only attend that specific session, share ideas and attachments then end session!
